# Delhivery-Logistics-Data-Analysis-and-Forecasting
##Problem Statement:
We have been given data on trips performed by parcels for Delhivery, which has attributes like trip_creation_time, routes, source and destination places, and open-source routing engine time. We need to clean, sanitize and manipulate data and get useful features and provide data to help them build forecasting models.

##Business Insights:
The timeframe of the data spans from '2018-09-12' to '2018-10-08', totaling 26 days.
88% of the trips occurred in October, while the remaining trips took place in November.
The analysis indicates that a greater proportion of shipments are routed via Full Truck Load (FTL) compared to carting, which has significant implications for the efficiency and speed of the delivery process.
The states of Haryana, Maharashtra, and Karnataka not only serve as busy source states but also emerge as the busiest, reflecting a high demand or substantial business activities originating from these regions.
Gurgaon, Bangalore, and Bhiwandi are identified as the busiest source cities, indicating their crucial role in overall business operations and transportation activities.
Gurgaon, Bangalore, and Hyderabad are recognized as the busiest destination cities, highlighting their importance in terms of business activities and population movement.
The busiest route is from Bangalore_Nalamngla_H (Karnataka) to Bengaluru_KGAirport_HB (Karnataka), with an average distance of 28.03 km and an average travel time of 87.87 minutes.
Business Recommendations:
Optimize the transportation network within Karnataka to improve efficiency and reduce congestion using route optimization algorithms and real-time traffic monitoring.
Implement city-specific strategies to manage high traffic volumes in Gurgaon (source city) and Bangalore (destination city). Set more realistic delivery time expectations, as the mean OSRM time is less than the mean actual delivery time.
Adjust distance estimations for logistics planning since the mean OSRM distance is greater than the mean actual distance.
Use information from segment-specific OSRM distances and actual distances to refine route planning and optimize logistics.
Implement advanced demand forecasting techniques to anticipate peak travel times and adjust transportation services accordingly.
Improve accuracy in estimated delivery times and distances to enhance customer satisfaction.
A higher proportion of FTL shipments leads to faster delivery times, aligning with customer expectations for timely deliveries.
Conduct customer profiling for states like Maharashtra, Karnataka, Haryana, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh to understand major order origins and improve the buying and delivery experience.
Analyze differences between estimated and actual times/distances to aid in cost optimization.
Fine-tune logistics planning based on accurate measurements to enhance resource allocation and reduce operational costs.
Understand the strategic choice of FTL over carting to inform future decision-making processes.
Collaborate with stakeholders, including government authorities, transportation companies, and local communities, to develop comprehensive strategies for managing and optimizing transportation in busy corridors and cities.
